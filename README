Node.js implementation of AMP. (http://amp-protocol.net)

Currently just provides functionality to receive an AMP box and send an AMP
box (an AMP box being defined as a dictionary with utf8 strings as keys and
Buffers as values).

Server example:
Run "node lib/scrappyreceiver.js" and twisted's doc/core/examples/ampclient.py.
This just prints out the box received, but doesn't reply since the
serialization layer hasn't been implemented yet.

Client example:
Run twisted's doc/core/examples/ampserver.py and "node lib/txExClient.js".
An AMP box is hacked togethe to do call Sum on two numbers on the amp server.
The reply from the server (in AMP box form) is printed to the console.


TODO:
- AMP serialization format
- real sample server and client
