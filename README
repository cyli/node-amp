Node.js implementation of AMP. (http://amp-protocol.net)

Currently just provides functionality to receive an AMP box and send an AMP
box (an AMP box being defined as a dictionary with utf8 strings as keys and
Buffers as values).

Sample:
- "node lib/scrappyreceiver.js" and twisted's doc/core/examples/ampclient.py
- twisted's doc/core/examples/ampserver.py and "node lib/txExClient.js"
